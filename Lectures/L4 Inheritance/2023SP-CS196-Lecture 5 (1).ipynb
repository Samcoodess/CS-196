`__lt__`, `__gt__`, `__le__`, or `__ge__`)\n","- A named tuple can be another nice alternative to defining classes or dataclasses\n","  - However, named tuples are immutable, and have no methods\n","- Just like objects can have attributes and methods, the classes themselves can also have attributes and methods\n","  - A class attribute value may be thought of as:\n","    - a **default** value for all instances of that class\n","    - a CONSTANT for all instances of the class\n","    - a way to keep track of all things having to do with that class\n","  - There are two types of methods that belong to a class\n","    - `@classmethod`: has access to class attributes and other class/static methods\n","    - `@staticmethod`: has no access to its own class, just executes code in isolation\n","- Classes defined inside of other classes are called inner classes\n","  - An inner class is only visible from within its outer class, not globally\n","- Python enables you to create getters, setters, and deleters\n","  - Use `@property` decorator to create a getter method\n","  - Use `@x.setter` decorator to create a setter for variable `x`\n","  - Use `@x.deleter` decorator to
